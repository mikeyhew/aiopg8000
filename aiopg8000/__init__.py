    This function is part of the `DBAPI 2.0 specification
    <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_; however, the arguments of the
    function are not defined by the specification.

    :param stream_generator:
        A function that when called will produce a tuple of
        ``(asyncio.StreamReader, asyncio.StreamWriter)`` that is connected to
        the database.
    :param user:
        The username to connect to the PostgreSQL server with. If this is not
        provided, pg8000 looks first for the PGUSER then the USER environment
        variables.

        If your server character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then
        you need to provide ``user`` as bytes, eg.
        ``"my_name".encode('EUC-JP')``.

    :keyword database:
        The name of the database instance to connect with.  This parameter is
        optional; if omitted, the PostgreSQL server will assume the database
        name is the same as the username.

        If your server character encoding is not ``ascii`` or ``utf8``, then
        you need to provide ``database`` as bytes, eg.
        ``"my_db".encode('EUC-JP')``.

    :keyword password:
        The user password to connect to the server with.  This parameter is
        optional; if omitted and the database server requests password-based
        authentication, the connection will fail to open.  If this parameter
        is provided but not requested by the server, no error will occur.

    :keyword loop:
        Specify an asyncio loop; will defeault to ``asyncio.get_event_loop()``
        if not specified.



    :rtype:
        A :class:`Connection` object.
